Code Overview:
A Docker image including the code, dependencies, and settings required to operate the application is created when a Node.js web application is Dockerized. The image is defined by a Dockerfile that includes the application code, necessary dependencies, and the underlying Node.js runtime. Once the Dockerfile has been written, you may use the docker build command to construct the image and tag it with the -t flag. To launch a container from the image after it has been constructed, use the docker run command. Port mapping guarantees that your browser can reach the application. When a Node.js application is Dockerized, it offers portability, consistency, and scalability, which facilitates deployment and management in isolated environments and makes scaling with technologies like Kubernetes or Docker simple.
